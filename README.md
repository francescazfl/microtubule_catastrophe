# Microtubule Catastrophe Data Polishing

This repository dedicated to the microtubule catastrophe data polishing for BeBi103-2020 @caltech by Team Franoavan11: Evan Mun, Francesca-Zhoufan Li, and Noah Epstein.

The data is from the paper by Gardner, Zanic, and coworkers named "Depolymerizing Kinesins Kip3 and MCAK Shape Cellular Microtubule Architecture by Differential Control of Catastrophe" in which they investigated the dynamics of microtubule catastrophe, the switching of a microtubule from a growing to a shrinking state.
